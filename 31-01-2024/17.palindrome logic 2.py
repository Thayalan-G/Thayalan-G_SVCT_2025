# Given an integer x, return true if x is a 
# palindrome
# , and false otherwise.

 

# Example 1:

# Input: x = 121
# Output: true
# Explanation: 121 reads as 121 from left to right and from right to left.
# Example 2:

# Input: x = -121
# Output: false
# Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore it is not a palindrome.
# Example 3:

# Input: x = 10
# Output: false
# Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore it is not a palindrome.

# Program to check if a string is palindrome or not

my_str = 'aIbohPhoBiA'

# make it suitable for caseless comparison
my_str = my_str.casefold()

# reverse the string
rev_str = reversed(my_str)

# check if the string is equal to its reverse
if list(my_str) == list(rev_str):
   print("The string is a palindrome.")
else:
   print("The string is not a palindrome.")
